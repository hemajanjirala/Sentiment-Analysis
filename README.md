# Sentiment-Analysis

## The following are some of the problem statement

1)What is the distribution of the target variable (sentiment) in the dataset? (e.g., how many positive and negative sentiments)

2)What is the purpose of using the PorterStemmer and removing stopwords during the text preprocessing step?

3)How many features are used in the bag-of-words model created by the CountVectorizer?

4)What is the train-test split ratio used for splitting the data into training and testing sets?

5)What is the performance of the logistic regression model on the testing data in terms of accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report?

## The following are some of the conclutions.

1. The distribution of the target variable (sentiment):
The distribution of the target variable (sentiment) is not shown in the provided code.
We can assume that the 'target' column contains binary values (e.g., 0 for negative sentiment and 1 for positive sentiment) based on the typical sentiment analysis task.

2. The purpose of using the PorterStemmer and removing stopwords:
The purpose of using the PorterStemmer is to reduce words to their root form (e.g., "playing" becomes "play").
Removing stopwords (common words like "the", "and", "is") helps eliminate noise and focus on the meaningful words in the text.

3. The number of features used in the bag-of-words model:
The bag-of-words model created by the CountVectorizer uses a maximum of 1,500 features.
This is specified by the 'max_features=1500' parameter.

4. The train-test split ratio:
The train-test split ratio used is 0.2, which means 20% of the data is used for testing, and 80% is used for training.
This is specified by the 'test_size=0.2' parameter in the 'train_test_split' function.

5. The performance of the logistic regression model:
The performance of the logistic regression model on the testing data is not shown in the provided code.
The code prints the accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report, which provide insights into the model's performance.

6)What does the cv.transform function do, and why is it used for both X_train and y_test?

7)What does the classification_report function provide, and why is it useful for evaluating the model's performance

## The following are some of the conclutions.
1. The purpose of the preprocessing loop is to clean and preprocess the text data in the 'text' column of the dataframe (df).
It removes non-alphabetic characters, converts to lowercase, removes stop words, and lemmatizes the words.
The preprocessed text is stored in the 'corpus' list.

2. The 're' module is used for regular expressions to remove non-alphabetic characters from the text.
The 'stopwords' module from NLTK is used to remove common English stop words (e.g., 'the', 'a', 'is') from the text.
These steps help in reducing noise and retaining only the relevant words for further analysis.

3. The 'WordNetLemmatizer' from NLTK is used to lemmatize the words, which means converting them to their base or root form.
This helps in reducing the number of unique words and grouping together related words with the same meaning.
Lemmatization improves the accuracy of text analysis and modeling techniques.

4. The 'train_test_split' function is used to split the data into training and testing sets.
The 'test_size' parameter specifies the proportion of data to be used for testing (33% in this case).
The 'random_state' parameter ensures reproducibility by setting a fixed seed for the random number generator.

5. The 'LogisticRegression' model is a classification algorithm used for binary or multi-class classification tasks.
In this code, it is trained on the training data ('X_train_cv' and 'y_train') using the 'fit' method.
The trained model can then be used to make predictions on new, unseen data.

6. The 'cv.transform' function is likely a CountVectorizer or TfidfVectorizer method from scikit-learn.
It is used to convert the text data into a numerical format (e.g., a sparse matrix) that can be understood by machine learning models.
It is applied to both the training and testing data for consistency and compatibility with the trained model.

7. The 'classification_report' function from scikit-learn provides a detailed evaluation of the model's performance.
It calculates and displays metrics such as precision, recall, f1-score, and support for each class in the classification task.
This report is useful for understanding the model's strengths and weaknesses and identifying areas for improvement.

# Sentiment Analysis using RNN.
## The following are some of the problem statement

1. What is the purpose of the `func` function, and how is it used to transform the 'sentiment' column in the `train_ds` and `validation_ds` datasets?

2. Explain the purpose of the `to_categorical` function and how it is used to encode the target variable (`y_train` and `y_test`) in the given code.

3. What is the difference between label encoding and one-hot encoding, and how are they used in the provided code snippet?

4. Explain the role of the `Tokenizer` class from `tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.text` and how it is used to convert text data into sequences of integers.

5. Describe the purpose of the `preprocess_data` function, and provide an example of a preprocessing step that could be included in this function.

6. What is the purpose of the code block that plots the logistic curve and an orange curve? Explain the role of the `orange_curve` function and how it could be modified to plot a different curve.

7. Explain the purpose of the `tqdm` library and how it is used in the provided code snippets to display progress bars during the training process.
   
 ## The following are some of the conclutions.

9. 1. The `func` function is used to map the sentiment labels ('positive', 'negative', and any other value) to numerical values (0, 1, and 2, respectively). It is applied to the 'sentiment' column of `train_ds` and `validation_ds` using the `apply` method to transform the textual sentiment labels into numerical values.

2. The `to_categorical` function is used for one-hot encoding of the target variable. It converts the numerical target values into a binary matrix representation, where each row represents a sample, and each column represents a class. This encoding is commonly used for multi-class classification problems, as it allows the model to interpret the target variable as a set of independent binary variables.

3. Label encoding and one-hot encoding are two different techniques used for encoding categorical variables. Label encoding assigns a unique numerical value to each category, while one-hot encoding creates a binary column for each category, with a value of 1 indicating the presence of that category and 0 for all other categories. The provided code demonstrates both techniques: label encoding using `LabelEncoder` and one-hot encoding using `OneHotEncoder`.

4. The `Tokenizer` class from `tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.text` is used to convert text data into sequences of integers. It creates a vocabulary of unique words or tokens and assigns a unique integer index to each token. The `fit_on_texts` method builds the vocabulary from the training data, and `texts_to_sequences` converts the text data into lists of token indices based on the learned vocabulary.

5. The `preprocess_data` function is designed to apply various preprocessing steps to the training and testing data before feeding it into a machine learning model. An example of a preprocessing step that could be included in this function is feature scaling or normalization. This could involve using techniques like `MinMaxScaler` or `StandardScaler` from scikit-learn to scale the features to a common range or distribution, which can improve the performance of certain machine learning algorithms.

6. The code block that plots the logistic curve and an orange curve is used for visualization purposes. The `orange_curve` function defines the equation for the orange curve (in this case, a sine wave). This function can be modified to plot a different curve by changing the equation inside the function. The code then creates a figure and axis using `matplotlib`, plots both the logistic curve and the orange curve, sets labels and a title, and displays the plot.

7. The `tqdm` library is used to display progress bars during long-running operations, such as training loops or data processing tasks. In the provided code snippets, `tqdm` is used to create a progress bar that shows the current iteration of a loop simulating the training process. This helps to provide visual feedback on the progress of the training or any other iterative task being performed. The length of the progress bar can be adjusted by modifying the range of the loop iterations.

2. Explain the role of the `brown` and `gutenberg` corpora from NLTK, and provide examples of how they are used in the code.

3. How does the code search for specific file IDs (e.g., containing "Bible" or "bible") in the Gutenberg corpus, and what is the purpose of this search?

4. Describe the purpose of the `FreqDist` class from the `nltk.probability` module, and provide examples of how it is used in the code to calculate word frequencies.

5. What is the purpose of the `bigrams` function from NLTK, and how is it used in the code?

6. Explain the role of stop words in natural language processing, and how the code filters out stop words from a given sentence.

7. What is the purpose of the `PorterStemmer` class from the `nltk.stem` module, and how is it used in the code to stem words?

8. ## The following are some of the conclutions.

1. The `word_tokenize` function is used to tokenize a given string into a list of words or tokens, while the `sent_tokenize` function tokenizes a string into a list of sentences. In the provided code, `word_tokenize` is used to split the string `x` into a list of words `z`, and `sent_tokenize` is used to split `x` into a list of sentences `y`.

2. The `brown` and `gutenberg` corpora are part of NLTK's collection of pre-loaded text data. The `brown` corpus contains text from various genres, while the `gutenberg` corpus contains a collection of books from Project Gutenberg. The code demonstrates how to access the words and sentences from these corpora using their respective methods (e.g., `brown.words()`, `gutenberg.words()`, `gutenberg.sents()`).

3. The code searches for specific file IDs in the Gutenberg corpus that contain the word "Bible" or "bible" (case-insensitive) using a regular expression search (`re.search`). This search is performed to identify and retrieve the text of the Bible from the Gutenberg corpus. The resulting file IDs are stored in the `bible_ids` list.

4. The `FreqDist` class from the `nltk.probability` module is used to calculate the frequency distribution of elements in a given list or corpus. In the provided code, `FreqDist` is used to count the occurrences of words in a sentence (`sentence` and `NLP_tokens`). The resulting frequency distribution can be printed or accessed using various methods (e.g., `fdist['word']` to get the frequency of a specific word, `fdist.most_common(n)` to get the `n` most frequent words).

5. The `bigrams` function from NLTK is used to generate bigrams (pairs of adjacent items) from a given list or sequence. In the code, `NLP_bigrams` is a list of bigrams created from the `NLP_tokens` list. Bigrams are commonly used in natural language processing tasks like language modeling and text generation.

6. Stop words are common words (e.g., "the", "a", "is") that often carry little meaning and can be filtered out during text preprocessing. The code demonstrates how to obtain a set of English stop words from the `nltk.corpus` module using `stopwords.words("english")`. It then filters out the stop words from a given sentence (`NLP_tokens`) by checking if each word is present in the stop word set and appending the non-stop words to a new list (`filtered_sen`).

7. The `PorterStemmer` class from the `nltk.stem` module is used for stemming words, which is the process of reducing words to their base or root form. In the provided code, an instance of `PorterStemmer` (`ps`) is created, and the `stem` method is applied to a list of sample words (`sample_words`). The stemmed versions of these words are printed, demonstrating the stemming process (e.g., "python", "python", "pythonli", "python").

 # OBJECT DETECTION AND TRACKING IN VIDEOS.
 ## The following are some of the problem statement.
 
1. What is the purpose of the `Tracker` class, and how does it work in the context of object tracking?

2. Explain the role of the `Detection` class and its attributes (`tlwh`, `confidence`, and `feature`).

3. What is the purpose of the `iou` function, and how does it calculate the intersection over union between a bounding box and a set of candidate bounding boxes?

4. Describe the purpose of the `iou_cost` function and how it is used in the context of object tracking.

5. Explain the role of the `_match` function in the code and how it associates confirmed and unconfirmed tracks with detections.

6. What is the purpose of the `_initiate_track` function, and when is it called during the object tracking process?

7. Explain the overall workflow of the code, including how it processes the input data (video sequences), generates results, and saves the output videos.

  
 ## The following are some of the conclutions.

 1. The `Tracker` class is responsible for tracking objects across multiple frames in a video sequence. It uses the DeepSORT algorithm, which combines object detections with a deep learning-based feature extractor to associate detections with existing object tracks. The `update` method processes each frame by encoding the detected bounding boxes into features and updating the existing tracks or creating new tracks based on the feature similarities.

2. The `Detection` class represents a bounding box detection in a single image frame. It has three main attributes: `tlwh` (top-left x, top-left y, width, height) representing the bounding box coordinates, `confidence` indicating the confidence score of the detection, and `feature` which is a feature vector describing the object within the bounding box. This class is used to encapsulate the information about each detected object in a frame.

3. The `iou` function calculates the Intersection over Union (IoU) between a single bounding box (`bbox`) and a set of candidate bounding boxes (`candidates`). It computes the area of overlap between the `bbox` and each candidate, and divides it by the total area covered by both boxes. The IoU metric is commonly used to evaluate the quality of object detections and track assignments.

4. The `iou_cost` function computes a cost matrix based on the IoU between existing tracks and new detections. It calculates the IoU cost (1 - IoU) between each track and detection pair, which represents the dissimilarity between them. This cost matrix is used in the track assignment process to determine the best match between tracks and detections based on their spatial overlap.

5. The `_match` function is responsible for associating confirmed and unconfirmed tracks with new detections. It first matches confirmed tracks using appearance features (deep learning-based feature similarity) and a gating mechanism to filter out unlikely matches. Then, it matches the remaining unconfirmed tracks and unmatched detections using the IoU cost metric. This two-stage process aims to leverage both appearance and spatial information for robust track association.

6. The `_initiate_track` function is called when a new detection cannot be associated with any existing track. It creates a new track by initializing its mean, covariance, and other track properties based on the detection's bounding box and feature vector. This function is responsible for starting to track a new object that has been detected in the scene.

7. The overall workflow of the code is as follows:
   a. It processes each video sequence in the `args.mot_dir` directory.
   b. For each sequence, it reads the detection results from the corresponding file in `args.result_dir`.
   c. It processes each frame by updating the `Tracker` object with the new detections.
   d. The updated tracks are used to generate an output video file (`%s.avi` or `%s.mp4`) in the `args.output_dir` directory, which shows the tracked objects with their respective IDs.
   e. If `args.convert_h264` is set, it converts the output videos from AVI to MP4 format for better compatibility.
